1.	Data_preprocessing_and_feature_selction.py contains Python code focused on preprocessing data and selecting important features for machine learning models. A power transformation is applied to stabilize variance and make the data more Gaussian-like, which can be beneficial for many machine learning models. Several feature selection techniques are used to identify the most relevant variables:
    o	Mutual Information Regression: This is used to estimate the dependency between features and the target variable.
    o	Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE): RFE is applied to iteratively remove less important features based on model performance.
    o	Permutation Importance: This method is used to compute feature importance by randomly shuffling each feature and observing the effect on model performance.
    o	Tree-based Feature Selection: Tree-based models (RandomForest, GradientBoosting) are used to rank features based on their importance.

2.	Generate_new_compostions_GAN_VAE.py contains Python code to generate new alloy compositions using a hybrid Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and Variational Autoencoder (VAE) approach. 
    o	Generator Model: This model takes a latent dimension (a random vector) as input and generates new alloy compositions. The architecture consists of multiple layers of dense neurons with LeakyReLU activations and batch normalization to stabilize training.
    o	Discriminator Model: Though not fully visible in this snippet, the discriminator is typically responsible for distinguishing between real and generated data, learning to classify generated compositions as either real or fake.
    o	Encoder Model: As part of the VAE framework, the encoder compresses the input data (alloy compositions) into a latent space representation, which the generator can later use to produce new samples.
Once trained, the GAN and VAE models can be used to generate new alloy compositions by sampling from the learned latent space. The generator creates new data, while the discriminator ensures that the compositions are realistic. The idea behind combining GANs and VAEs is to leverage the generative power of both architectures, ensuring that the generated compositions resemble the real dataset while exploring new regions of the composition space.

3.	RELM_Establishment_Training_Predictions_Explaninable_Interpretations.py is focused on the establishment, training, and prediction of models within the context of the Residual Hybrid Learning Model (RELM). BayesSearchCV is used for Bayesian optimization of hyperparameters to improve model performance. RELM integrates predictions from multiple models (ensemble, kernel-based, and neural networks) in a residual learning framework, where each model improves upon the errors (residuals) of the previous models. This framework is focused on creating highly explainable predictions for materials science data, particularly where model performance and interpretability are critical for decision-making.
